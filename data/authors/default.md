I am a Data Analyst, statistical storyteller, and technology enthusiast, with skills in full stack web development. I come from a background in the public sector, implementing digital transformation and human centered design to enhance the service experience for citizens.

Im a huge coffee nerd, with a love for all things outdoors. This is my personal blog and digital garden, a creative outlet to document my thoughts and interests.
